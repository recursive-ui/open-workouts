    "notes": "If you're using it as a starting exercise, just follow the instructions in the video and\ndisregard the following. If you're using it as a light variation, for a super-set or as a\nfinisher, follow these tips: maintain a completely vertical torso by elevating your arms\nforward during the descend and achieve a full stretch in the quads to the point where\nthe calves and hamstrings are pressing against each other, stand on tiptoe if necessary\nto achieve that (what? sacrilege! Yeah with a loaded barbell on you back or if you're\nvery weak maybe, here it's not a problem). Begin by isometrically contracting the\nquads hard, then slow tempo down, pause, explode up, lock the knees, don't pause,\ndon't release the strong quad contraction from the beginning, come back down; it will\nburn. You can load some extra weight in a backpack, or holding onto something with\nyour hands (making it a goblet squat)."

    "notes": "The weight you're moving here is roughly equivalent to a bench press loaded with\n82% of your body weight. Notice the feet separation. What you're doing here is\nessentially a one arm push-up, but using the arm you keep straight for a little\nassistance. Complete the set with one arm, then move on to the other arm, don't do\none rep each because it alters the path of the working arm shortening the effective\nrange of motion of the pecs. Completely rest the chest on the floor on each rep for\nhalf a second, keep the pushing shoulder back and down as during a regular push-up,\nexplode up, lock the elbow, maintain a half second contraction while attempting to\nbring your working hand closer to the other one, descend with a full 2 seconds tempo.\nDon't push yourself away from your working hand to the side when you press (making\nthe grip width wider at the top), that way of making up for being too weak to do the\nexercise shortens the effective range of motion and removes tension, if you need\nassistance to do the exercise it's much better to bend your straight arm a little so that\nit can assist more\n, that way you lose nothing. If you can't complete 5 reps with one arm during a set,\neither use the assisted method detailed before to complete it, and/or do rest-pause\nuntil you do: you stop the set short of 5, rest for 3-5 deep breaths, then continue the\nset inserting more rest pauses until you get 5 total reps with that arm. You can\nincrease the tension with bands\nsame as with the regular push-ups."

    "notes": "The weight you're moving here is roughly equivalent to a bench press loaded with\n100% of your body weight, plus the stability demands. Because you usually can't move\nstraight from the archer push-up to the full one arm push-up because there's a big\ndifference in the resistance, you go through this intermediate variation first. Complete\nthe set with one arm, then move on to the other arm. Key points: your knees have to\nbe quite separated, and your resting hand is placed at the side of your thigh (don't put\nit behind your back). I recommend you put something cushy below the knee that's\nopposite to your working hand. Completely rest the chest on the floor on each rep for\nhalf a second, explode up, lock the elbow, maintain a half second contraction while\nattempting to bring your working hand across your body, descend with a full 2\nseconds tempo. To achieve balance, DON'T focus on flexing the spinal erectors\nopposite to your working arm, instead, focus on flexing the obliques (abs) of the same\nside as your working arm. If you can't complete 5 reps with each arm in one set,\ncontinue the set using Archer push-ups\nand/or do rest-pause until you do: finish the set with one arm, rest for 3 deep\nbreaths, continue the set inserting more rest pauses until you get 5 total reps with\nthat arm."

Pause for 1 second at the bottom, getting a full stretch, then\nexplode up, sticking your chest out pulling your shoulders back, get to full contraction\npulling your elbows back as far as they go, don't pause and go back down slowly\ncontrolling the movement; pull towards your upper abdomen or lower chest. You can\nuse an overhand grip or an underhand grip. You can use a table\n, or a stick and two chairs\n, or the bedsheet method"

    "notes": "The weight you're moving here is roughly equivalent to a bench press loaded with\n1.3 times your body weight, plus the stability demands. Complete the set with one\narm, then move on to the other arm. Completely rest the chest on the floor on each\nrep for half a second, explode up, lock the elbow, maintain a half second contraction\nwhile attempting to bring your working hand across your body, descend with a full 2\nseconds tempo. Don't do funky stuff with your shoulder\n(2:23) you will see TONS of people screwing this up out of rushing to be able to do\nthis exercise; know that not only is this bad for the shoulder, it removes both ROM\nand tension from the chest. DON'T twist your torso at any point; to achieve balance,\nDON'T focus on flexing the spinal erectors opposite to your working arm, instead,\nfocus on flexing the obliques (abs) of the same side as your working arm. If you can't\ncomplete 5 reps with each arm in one set, continue the set with your knees on the\nfloor and/or do rest-pause until you do: finish the set with one arm, rest for 3 deep\nbreaths, continue the set inserting more rest pauses until you get 5 total reps with\nthat arm. To keep increasing the intensity, either use bands or find a way to put\nweight on your back."
